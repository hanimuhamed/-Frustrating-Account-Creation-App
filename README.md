Frustrating Account Creation App

Welcome to the Frustrating Account Creation App, my entry for the Useless Projects Hackathon! This app is designed to take the concept of creating an account to new (and absurdly frustrating) levels. Here's what you can expect:

Features:

Absurd Password Requirements:
When you try to create an account, the password entry field will ask for a bizarre series of conditions that are both random and absurdly difficult to fulfill.
If you‚Äôre finding it too hard, don‚Äôt worry! I included a text file with a "master password" you can copy-paste to get through this section.

"Guess Your Phone Number" Challenge:
After creating an account, you‚Äôll need to verify your phone number ‚Äî but not in the usual way!
Instead of entering it directly, the app will try to guess it by asking a series of questions like "Is your number bigger than this?" It takes up to 32 questions to get it right, turning verification into a hilarious ordeal.

Cat Appreciation CAPTCHA:
To verify you‚Äôre human, you‚Äôll be shown a picture of a cat and asked if you like this creature.
If you say "yes," you pass (because who doesn‚Äôt love cats, right?).
If you say "no," the app will threaten to delete your account ‚Äî unless you tap ‚Äúsorry‚Äù ten times to prove you‚Äôre sorry.

The Final Surprise:
Once you make it through all the challenges, a surprise awaits you. But what it is‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll just have to see for yourself!
This app is intentionally over-the-top to explore just how frustrating (but funny) account creation can be. Enjoy the experience, or at least try to! üòà
